            <h3>About Brown Bears</h3>
            <p>The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear with the widest distribution 
                of any living ursid.[2] The species is distributed across much of northern
                 Eurasia and North America. It is one of the two largest terrestrial 
                 carnivorans alive today, rivaled in body size only by its close cousin, the 
                 polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in size and averages 
                 larger due to this. There are several recognized subspecies, many of 
                 which are quite well-known within their native ranges, found in the brown bear 
                 species.</p>

                <h3>Features</h3>
                <p>Brown bears are not always completely brown. Some can be reddish or 
                    yellowish. They have very large, curved claws and huge paws. Male brown 
                    bears are often 30% larger than female brown bears. They can range from 5 
                    feet to 9 feet from head to toe.</p>

                    <h3>Where Brown Bears lurks</h3>
                    <p>Brown bears were once native to much of Asia, some parts of the Atlas Mountains 
                        of Africa and perhaps most of Europe and North America, but are now extinct
                         in some areas, and their populations have greatly decreased in other areas.
                         There are approximately 200,000 brown bears left in the world.
                         The largest populations are in Russia with 120,000, the United States 
                         with 32,500, and Canada with around 25,000.The brown bear currently occurs
                          in the countries of Afghanistan, Albania, Andorra (recently reoccupied),
                           Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bhutan (possibly extinct), Bosnia and
                            Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czech Republic 
                            (possibly only vagrants), Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Greece, India, 
                            Iran, Iraq, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
                             Latvia (extinct before World War II; possibly vagrants from Estonia or 
                             Russia after World War II), Republic of Macedonia, Mongolia, Montenegro, 
                             Nepal, North Korea, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia,
